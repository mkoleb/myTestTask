1. All test passed on the following configuration: win7, firefox 53.0.3 (x64), selenium 3.4.0;
2. Added Allure reporting, and, as you mentioned in task, used PageObject and PageFactory;
3. If i had more time I'll add TestNG support (parallel test runs, run in groups, testing on different browsers etc); loging; running   tests using Selenium Grid for crooss-browser checks. And of course, I'll make my code more readable by literate refactoring :)

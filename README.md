路 All test passed on the following configuration: win7, firefox 53.0.3 (x64), selenium 3.4.0;
路 Added Allure reporting, and, as you mentioned in task, used PageObject and PageFactory;
路 To run tests type in terminal "mvn clean test site";
路 If i had more time I'll add TestNG support (parallel test runs, run in groups, testing on different browsers etc); loging; running tests   using Selenium Grid for crooss-browser checks. And of course, I'll make my code more readable by literate refactoring :)
